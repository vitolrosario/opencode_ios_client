# OpenCode iOS Client

A native iOS client for [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode). Connect to your OpenCode server from your iPhone or iPad to chat with AI agents, monitor tool calls in real time, and browse code changes on the go.

No Apple Developer account needed. Just tap the link on your iOS device.

## Features

- **Chat**: send messages, switch models, view AI replies with streaming, inspect tool calls and reasoning
- **Files**: file tree browser, session diffs, markdown preview, image preview with zoom/pan, code view with line numbers
- **Settings**: server connection, Basic Auth, SSH tunnel, theme, voice transcription

### Hardware keyboard behavior on iPad

- `Enter`: send the current message when text input is not in IME composition
- `Shift+Enter`: insert a newline
- Chinese/Japanese IME composition is allowed to commit marked text before any send action fires

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- A running OpenCode server (`opencode serve` or `opencode web`)
- Xcode 16+ (only if building from source)

## Quick Start

1. Start OpenCode on your Mac: `opencode serve --port 4096`
2. Open the iOS app, go to Settings, enter the server address (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:4096`)
3. Tap Test Connection
4. Switch to Chat, create or select a session, and start talking

## Remote Access

The app is designed for LAN use by default. Two options for remote access:

**HTTPS + public server (recommended)**: deploy OpenCode on a public server with TLS. Point the iOS app to `https://your-server.com:4096` and configure Basic Auth credentials.

**SSH Tunnel**: the app has a built-in SSH tunnel (powered by Citadel). Set up a reverse tunnel from your home machine to a VPS, then configure the tunnel in Settings > SSH Tunnel. See `docs/` for detailed steps.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grapeot/OpenCodeClient.git
cd OpenCodeClient/OpenCodeClient
open OpenCodeClient.xcodeproj
```

Select the `OpenCodeClient` scheme, pick a simulator or device, and hit Run. Swift Package dependencies resolve automatically on first build.
